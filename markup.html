Lets imagine you just crafted a lengthy email. While proof reading, you decide the entire third paragraph should be bold for emphasis.

OK, that sounds easy, you select the text and hit the B icon on screen or maybe you type CMD+B and now your text is bold. You proof read it once more and conclude that bold isn't enough. You want the third paragraph in ALL CAPS, but you realize that requires you to retype the whole paragraph. The very thought of REtyping it makes you ANGRY – but instead of getting angry, you simply select the text you want to change and press CAPS LOCK. – It could be that easy.

Seriously, Try it.
Select some text then press Caps Lock to toggle your selection between UPPERCASE & lowercase. Ignore the little light on the Caps lock key.
