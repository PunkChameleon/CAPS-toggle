Lets imagine you just crafted a lengthy email. While proof reading, you decide that you want the entire third paragraph to be bold for emphasis.

OK, that sounds easy, you select the text and hit the B icon near the top of the screen or maybe you type CMD+B and now your text is bold. You proof read it once more and decide that bold isn't enough. You want the third paragraph in ALL CAPS, but you realize that means you would have to retype the whole paragraph and just the Thought of REtyping IT makes you ANGRY – but instead of getting angry, you simply select the text you want to change and tap the CAPS LOCK key. – It could be that easy.

Seriously, Try it.
Select some text then press Caps Lock to toggle your selected text between UPPERCASE & lowercase. Ignore the little light on the Caps lock key.
